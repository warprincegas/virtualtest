Sometimes, cached data can interfere with action resolution. Clear any caches related to GitHub Actions and try deploying again.

### Sample GitHub Pages Workflow for Vite Project

Hereâ€™s a basic GitHub Actions setup for deploying a Vite project to GitHub Pages:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
push:
 branches:
   - main  # Change to your default branch if needed

permissions:
contents: write

jobs:
build:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 steps:
   - name: Checkout repository
     uses: actions/checkout@v3

   - name: Setup Node.js
     uses: actions/setup-node@v3
     with:
       node-version: '16'  # Specify your Node version

   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm install

   - name: Build the project
     run: npm run build

   - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
     uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  # Use the correct GitHub Pages deploy action
     with:
       github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       publish_dir: ./dist  # Point to the 'dist' folder generated by Vite
